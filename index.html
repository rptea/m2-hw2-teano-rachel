        <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p> Hi, my name is Rach! I just turned 33 and I'm in that weird phase of my life where I'm just figuring out what it is I want to do with my life. I'm doing my best, I swear!</p>
        <h2> My Hobbies</h2>

                        <li>I like fantasy and sci-fi, but lately I've been reading more fiction.</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>A little more about me!</h2>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my significant other. Together, we'll put on a YouTube video and he'll hop on RS (Runescape, if you're unaware), and I'll hop on Brighter Shores.</p>
            <p>Outside of my personal life, I'm a Student Engagement Advisor at my local community college. I previously produced marketing materials for our Diversity and Social Change department, but due to the pandemic in 2020, I was forced to accept an advisor position. While my current position doesn't allow me as much time as I'd like to design, I've grown to love working with my student leaders.</p>
            <p>On a random note, my favorite animals are cats, and I swear I was a cat in my previous life.</p>
